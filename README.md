LOS-Constrained Multi-Robot Coordination Using MLCCST
This repository implements a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based framework for maintaining Line-of-Sight (LOS) connectivity in a multi-robot system using the Minimum Line-of-Sight Connectivity Constraint Spanning Tree (MLCCST) algorithm. The simulation models a team of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) navigating towards task goals while preserving global and subgroup connectivity in obstacle-filled environments.
